### Blue Green Deployment
#### Step 1: Blue env

#### Step 2: B/G deployment

#### Step 3: Switch over started

#### Step 4: App connected to greem

#### Step 5: B/G deployment success

#### Blue Green Environment Creation
##### B/G Env. Creation has 3 steps, which take approximately 45 to 50 mins,Â 
###### Creating a read replica of the source

###### Db engine version upgrade
###### Configure backups

Note:

Above observation of B/G creation time is tested with one table with 103,250 records.
If any of the above steps fail, b/g deployment tries to fix the issue.
